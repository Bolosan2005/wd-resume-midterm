                <p class="upper">FEU Institute of Technology (FEU Tech) is a private, non-sectarian institution located in Sampaloc, Manila, Philippines. Established in 1992 as the East Asia Computer Center, it focuses on Engineering and Computer Studies. Recognized as a Center of Development in IT Education by the Commission on Higher Education, FEU Tech is closely affiliated with Far Eastern University.
                 <br></p>
                <p class="bottom"> The institution is led by President Juan Miguel R. Montinola and Senior Executive Director Dr. Benson T. Tan. FEU Tech operates on a trimester system, with the academic year beginning in the second week of August and concluding in June, similar to its sister schools, FEU Diliman and FEU Alabang.</p><br>
                <p class="bottom">Fun factâ€”though not so fun for meâ€”my mom chose FEU as my college, despite the high tuition fees. I once asked her if I could transfer, but she believes that graduating from a well-known or prestigious school will open up better career opportunities for me.</p>
