            <p>I am currently in the process of reviving the goals that inspired me to pursue my chosen course. One of the main reasons I selected this path was to refine my skills in drawing and expand my creative abilities. I also wanted to strike a balance between honing my craft and allowing myself the space to relax and unwind amidst the stresses of everyday life. I believe that maintaining this balance is essential for both personal and professional growth. </p> <br>

                <p>However, Iâ€™ve found it challenging to dedicate consistent time to drawing. Between school activities, managing deadlines, and the general pressures of student life, itâ€™s difficult to carve out the necessary space for creativity. There are days when I feel too stressed or unmotivated to even pick up a pencil, which can be frustrating. I recognize that this is part of the processâ€”balancing passion with responsibilityâ€”but itâ€™s not always easy. </p> <br>
                
                <p>That said, I remain committed to pushing through these obstacles. I know that improvement takes time and dedication, and I am determined to continue developing my skills despite the setbacks. I hope to reach a point where I can confidently look back and say that I made the right decision in choosing this career pathâ€”one that aligns with my passion for art and creativity. Ultimately, my goal is to ensure that the pursuit of this path not only enhances my professional abilities but also fosters a sense of personal fulfillment.</p>
