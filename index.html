            <h3>Multimedia Artist Student</h3>
            <p>Hello, I chose Multimedia Arts to improve my drawing skills and focus on my career goals. Creating this website has been an exciting yet challenging experience. Iâ€™ve sought help to refine some areas, so I appreciate your understanding if any part of my code seems unpolished</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p class="upper">As an introvert, I often prefer to spend time alone, fully immersing myself in what I enjoy. While I find comfort in solitude, it can be challenging, especially in college, where collaboration and support from others become essential to navigate the tougher moments.</p>
            <p class="bottom">One of my favorite hobbies, aside from media-related activities, is reading anime manga. It provides a much-needed escape from reality and helps me relax. While enjoying time alone has its benefits, it also comes with its challenges.</p>
